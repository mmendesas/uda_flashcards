## What I've learned

- I use a lot of React fundamentals for building all components
- I really get my hands durty with React Native concepts
- I've tried following a few steps to design my components in the planning stage
- I also implemented this project using react-redux
- I've learned a lot of new things using AsyncStorage
_ I also pratice some new interactions with react-navigation

## How to test this implementation

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

> This solution was tested in Android device

    yarn
    ```

2. Start in development mode:
    ```sh

    ```

3. Just follow the instructions presented on the terminal
    > You will need to configure an emulator to test this solution, or just scan the **QR code** using the Expo App
